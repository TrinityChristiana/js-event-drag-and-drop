The user should be able to drag one of the middle cards into either the top box, or the bottom box. However, there's a problem with the way the code currently works. There's also a couple changes you need to make.

1. If you drag one of the cards into the top/bottom box, and then drag another card into the first one, you get a nested card. You need to prevent this from happening.
<!-- 2. The user should only be able to drag one card into either box. Use the childNodes property to ensure that, if a card is already in the box, another can't be added. -->
<!-- 3. The user should be able to move a card from the top/bottom box back to the middle.# js-event-drag-and-drop -->
